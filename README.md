## Import the required libraries and dependencies
 
 
`import pandas as pd`

`from pathlib import Path`

`import tensorflow as tf`

`from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense`

`from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`

`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`

`from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder`


## Results

The accuracy score for the original, alternative 1, and alternative 2 models included 0.7297, 0.7298, and 
0.7301 repectively.The alternative model 2 performed slightly better than the original model.
